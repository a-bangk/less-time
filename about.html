        <h1>About Adam Time</h1>
	<p>We all live in and share the same time. The clock is always ticking, Adam Time was made with the intent to seperate us from the consent ticking of the clock. The 24-hour day is divided in 16 90 minute blocks. Each block is then divided into a start, middle and end. There are no time zones in Adam-Time, as we travel the world we divide different new relationships to the symbols. 🦋  may go from being the middle of the night to when we wake up. The <a href="adam-time.php">🕰️</a> will take you to Adam-time.</p> <a href="adam-time.php">🕰️</a>
