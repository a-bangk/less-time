  <h1>About Adam-Time</h1>
  <p>We all live in and share the same time. The clock is always ticking, Adam-Time was made with the intent to seperate
    us from the constant count.</p>
  <p> The 24-hour day is divided into 16, 90 minute blocks. Each block is then divided into 一, 二 and
    三.</p>
  <p> There are no time zones in Adam-Time, as we travel the world we develop new relationships to the symbols. 🦋 may
    go from being the middle of the night to when we wake up. The <a href="adam-time.html">🕰️</a> will show you the current
    Adam-Time.
