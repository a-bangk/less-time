        <h1>About Adam Time</h1>
	<p>We all live in and share the same time. The clock is always ticking, Adam Time was made with the intent to seperate us from the constant count.</p>
<p> The 24-hour day is divided into 16, 90 minute blocks. Each block is then divided into 初(start) , 中(middle) and 終(end).</p><p> There are no time zones in Adam-Time, as we travel the world we develop new relationships to the symbols. 🦋  may go from being the middle of the night to when we wake up. The <a href="adam-time.php">🕰️</a> will take you to Adam-time.</p>
